<summary>What is React.js</summary>

### Intro

-   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   React is used to build single-page applications.
-   React allows us to create reusable UI components.

Note: You'll need to have Node >= 14 on your local development machine

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

or,

```
npm init react-app my-app
```

create-react-app includes built tools such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint.

### Virtual DOM

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed!
